# Dynamic Weather div

This project provides a customizable weather widget that can be easily embedded into any webpage. The widget allows users to enter a city name or coordinates to fetch and display the average temperature, wind speed, and humidity for each day of the week over the next two weeks. Additionally, the widget includes an icon for each day that visually represents the current weather condition, such as sunny, cloudy, rainy, or snowy, providing users with a quick and intuitive overview of the forecast.

## Usage

### Embedding the Weather Widget in Your Webpage

To use the weather widget in your own webpage, follow these steps:

   - Link the `styles.css` file in the `<head>` section of your HTML document to apply the necessary styles to the widget.
   
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="path_to_styles.css">
   ```

2. **Add the Weather Widget Div:**
   - Add a `<div>` element with the ID `weather-widget` to your HTML document where you want the widget to appear.

   ```html
   <div id="weather-widget"></div>
   ```

   ```html
   <script src="path_to_script.js"></script>
   ```

4. **Initialize the Weather Widget:**
   - The `script.js` will automatically populate the `#weather-widget` div with the weather data once the page is loaded.

### Example of Complete HTML Setup

Hereâ€™s an example of how your HTML file might look when embedding the weather widget:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Weather Widget</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div id="weather-widget"></div>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Notes:

- **Path Adjustments:** Ensure that the paths to `styles.css` and `script.js` are correct based on your directory structure.
